Happy Birthday Ziii 💖

sbse pehle toh Happy Birthday my sweety Princess🫂❤️
Stay blessed, stay healthy, be happy, keep growing and 
keep enjoying your life to the fullest.

I won't say much but just you know that 
since the day I got this much attached to you,
you have become more than just an editor to me,
you are part of my daily life, My day feels empty
without you, although we just share very little
time that too just through screen I like 
every moment and you being the happiest is my 
most favourite thing and you being sad is the last 
thing I could see.Actually, can't see😖 
It doesn't suit you Aap hmesha hste huye,khush
you being in your cheerfull side waise hi acche lgte ho 
mtlb acche toh hr treh se hi lgte ho but waise rha karo 
hmesha, accha lgta hai😇.
I never wanna see you getting hurt
cause that doesn't hurt only you.  
I don't easily say but when I say I'll be there 
for you , with you then I'LL BE THERE! and I mean that. 
Apna maan liya hai ab aapko , ab nhi jaane dungi.
I just wish aap bhi mujhe thoda sa apna maan lo 
enough that you could share your problems, your happy
moments , your sad moments , if something hurts you 
you could tell me without thinking much 🫂.
I care for you and I hope you know that.
That's all I would say.

And know that ... 

Babe! You are amazing the way you are 🫂❤️
You have this beautiful way of making
ordinary things, moments feel unforgettable.
Your smile, your kindness, your presence —
they mean more to me than words can explain.

I hope today reminds you of how loved,
valued, and truly special you are.
Not just today… but every single day.

I hope you like my small efforts
and that brought a precious smile on your pretty face 

Always keep smiling 🫶🏻🎂 
Lots of Love and Hugs 🫂❤️
